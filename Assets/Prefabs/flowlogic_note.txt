I was attempting to adapt from this online project https://github.com/zerefgd/Connect to get it working not only in the modern unity version, but also to have it generate on a more on-demand basis. 

My plan was to have the user select to open a flow puzzle and be presented with a randomly selected/generated board. They would have the option to forfeit the reward or solve the puzzle.
The procedural generation script was designed to randomly place nodes of different colors on the board and then make sure the pattern was capable of being solved.
